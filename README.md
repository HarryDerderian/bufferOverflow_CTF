# bufferOverflow_CTF
Buffer Overflow CTF for the Offensive Security Society. This challenge teaches students the risks of unsafe code by exploiting a buffer overflow in a Debian-based program to gain root shell access. Itâ€™s a hands-on lesson in low-level security, perfect for deepening understanding of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
