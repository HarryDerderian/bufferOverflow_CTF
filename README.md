# Buffer Overflow CTF - Offensive Security Society
Welcome to the Buffer Overflow CTF, a hands-on challenge designed for the Offensive Security Society. This Capture the Flag (CTF) project is tailored to help students and cybersecurity enthusiasts understand the critical consequences of unsafe coding practices, specifically focusing on buffer overflows.
# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a practical learning experience where participants will:
Understand the basics of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
Learn how unsafe code can lead to unintended and severe consequences.
Exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability to gain root-level shell access on a Debian-based system.
By completing this CTF, participants will develop a deeper understanding of the risks associated with insecure coding practices and the importance of writing safe and secure code.

# Challenge Overview
Participants are provided with a vulnerable program running on a Debian-based system. The objective is to identify the buffer overflow vulnerability and exploit it to obtain a root-level shell. This challenge mimics real-world scenarios where attackers take advantage of poorly written code to gain unauthorized access to systems.
